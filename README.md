`Software Development Student (Application & Web Development`

I'm an Software development student based in Antwerp Belgium. Most of my repo's are school projects but i have some personal projects!
As a Software Development student, I am passionate about investing my free time in the dynamic world of development. In addition to being a guide in our Youth Movement, 'Chiro Schelle,' I actively contribute by maintaining and developing our web applications, website and our google workspace. I find joy in the creative process of bringing ideas to life through coding.
